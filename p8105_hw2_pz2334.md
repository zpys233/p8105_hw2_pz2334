## Problem 2

``` r
mr_wheel_df =
  read_excel("202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N586") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na(dumpster) |>
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)),
         trash_wheel = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
         year = as.numeric(year))
```

``` r
professor_wheel_df =
  read_excel("202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M108") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na(dumpster) |>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Professor Trash Wheel",
         sports_balls = NA)
p_names <- names(professor_wheel_df)
```

``` r
gwynnda_wheel_df =
  read_excel("202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range = "A2:L157") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na(dumpster) |>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
         sports_balls = NA,
         glass_bottles = NA)
```

``` r
combined_trash_wheel <- bind_rows(mr_wheel_df, professor_wheel_df)
combined_trash_wheel <- bind_rows(combined_trash_wheel, gwynnda_wheel_df)
```

``` r
n_obs <- nrow(combined_trash_wheel)
n_vars <- ncol(combined_trash_wheel)
tot_weight_p <- combined_trash_wheel |>
  filter(trash_wheel == "Professor Trash Wheel") |>
  summarise(total_weight = sum(weight_tons, na.rm = TRUE))
cig_june2022_g <- combined_trash_wheel |>
  filter(trash_wheel == "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", year == 2022, month == "June") %>%
  summarise(total_butts = sum(cigarette_butts, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The dataset, after cleaning and combining data from Mr. Trash Wheel,
Professor Trash Wheel, and Gwynnda, includes 845 observations and 15
variables. The variables in this dataset are dumpster, month, year,
date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene,
cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers, homes_powered,
trash_wheel, sports_balls, which represent important metrics such as the
weight of trash collected (in tons), the number of cigarette butts, and
the number of sports balls. Among all these variables, we create
trash_wheel to identify the origin of this row of data. \\

During combining and cleaning process, we noticed that the Professor
Trash Wheel dataset did not contain any values for the sports balls
variable. Additionally, the variable “year” in this dataset was
originally stored as a character type, which differed from the other
datasets. So, we changed the data type for “year” to numeric. Also, we
add the sports balls variable, setting its values to NA to represent its
missing. \\

Similarly, in the Gwynnda dataset, there was no value for both sports
balls and glass bottles. So, we added these variables with NA values to
the Gwynnda dataset to maintain uniformity across all datasets. \\

For the available data in the combined dataframe, we can easily extract
specific measurements of interest. For instance, the total weight of
trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel amounts to 216.26. Similarly,
the total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June 2022 is
1.812^{4}. \\

## Problem 3

``` r
bakers =
  read_csv("gbb_datasets/bakers.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(baker = word(baker_name, 1),
  baker = if_else(baker == "Jo", "Joanne", baker))
```

    ## Rows: 120 Columns: 5
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (3): Baker Name, Baker Occupation, Hometown
    ## dbl (2): Series, Baker Age
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
bakes = 
  read_csv("gbb_datasets/bakes.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(baker = if_else(baker == '"Jo"', "Joanne", baker))
```

    ## Rows: 548 Columns: 5
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (3): Baker, Signature Bake, Show Stopper
    ## dbl (2): Series, Episode
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
results = 
  read_csv("gbb_datasets/results.csv", skip = 2) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na(result)
```

    ## Rows: 1136 Columns: 5
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (2): baker, result
    ## dbl (3): series, episode, technical
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
combined_df = left_join(results, bakes, by = c("baker", "episode", "series"))
combined_df = left_join(combined_df, bakers, by = c("baker", "series"))
```

``` r
unmatched_bakers <- anti_join(bakers, combined_df, by = c("baker", "series"))
unmatched_bakes <- anti_join(bakes, combined_df, by = c("baker", "series", "episode"))
unmatched_results <- anti_join(results, combined_df, by = c("baker", "series", "episode"))
```

``` r
combined_df = combined_df |>
  select(-baker)
c_names <- names(combined_df)
```

We quickly review the datasets during the cleaning process at beginning,
we can find out that the ‘result’ variable in results.csv is empty for
rows where the baker are OUT in the previous episode. So, we drop rows
where ‘result’ is NA. \\

After initial review, all three datasets included variables related to
series and baker names. However, bakers.csv lists full names. We create
a helper variable called ‘baker’ to facilitate merging the datasets.
After the merging process, anti_join used in checking process indicates
the inconsistency with a baker named “Jo,” who was absent in the other
two datasets. Go back to the original datasets, we found that “Jo” is
referred to “Joanne” in results.csv. So, we change this baker’s name
from “Jo” to “Joanne” in the other datasets to ensure a successful
merge. \\

After merging, we noticed redundancy with two columns referring to the
bakers’ names. So I removed the helper variable (the ‘baker’ column
which contained first names) to simplify the dataset. The final dataset
contains variable series, episode, technical, result, signature_bake,
show_stopper, baker_name, baker_age, baker_occupation, hometown. \\

``` r
winners <- combined_df |>
  filter(series %in% 5:10, result %in% c("WINNER", "STAR BAKER")) |>
  select(series, episode, result, baker_name)
```

After creating and viewing this datasets, we can easily check the winner
of each season and the star baker in each episode. It is surprising that
the winner in season 10 has never been a star baker in any of the
episode.
